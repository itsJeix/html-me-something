    <h1>Phileas</h1>
    <p>This is my cat Phileas. He is an adorable demon. As a cat, he is entirely useless, but here are the things that he does:</p>

  <main>
    <article>
      <h2>Napping</h2>
      <img src="images/napping.jpg"/>
      <p>Phileas spends most of his day napping. This is our couch from Ikea, it's called a Yorgsb&ouml;rg or something.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h2>Staring</h2>
      <img src="images/staring.jpg"/>
      <p>When he isn't napping he usually just finds somewhere to stare at you.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h2>Sleeping</h2>
      <img src="images/sleeping.jpg"/>
      <p>Sometimes a nap isn't good enough and he actually falls into a deep sleep.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h2>Plotting</h2>
      <img src="images/plotting.jpg"/>
      <p>This is what he looks like when he remembers that time you snuck in a quick belly rub without asking.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h2>Yawning</h2>
      <img src="images/yawning.jpg"/>
      <p>He also likes to yawn to let you know how boring you are.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h2>Sitting</h2>
      <img src="images/sitting.jpg"/>
      <p>And lastly he likes to make sure he finds a comfortable place to sit that also inconveniences you.</p>
